### BUILDING INTERACTIVE WEBSITES
Rock, Paper, or Scissors
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

Rock destroys scissors. <br>
Scissors cut paper.<br>
Paper covers rock.<br>
If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.<br>

Our code will break the game into four parts:<br>
Get the user’s choice.<br>
